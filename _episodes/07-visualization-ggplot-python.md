## Disclaimer

Python has powerful built-in plotting capabilities such as matplotlib, but for
this episode, we will be using the [plotnine](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine?tab=readme-ov-file)
package, which facilitates the creation of highly-informative plots of
structured data based on the R implementation of [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)
and [The Grammar of Graphics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F0-387-28695-0)
by Leland Wilkinson. The plotnine
package is built on top of Matplotlib and interacts well with Pandas.

## Reminder

plotnine is not included in the standard Anaconda installation and needs
to be installed separately. If you haven't done so already, you can find installation
instructions on the [Setup page](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/#required-python-packages).


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Just as with the other packages, plotnine needs to be imported. It is good
practice to not just load an entire package such as from plotnine import *,
but to use an abbreviation as we used pd for Pandas:

```python 
%matplotlib inline
import plotnine as p9
```

From now on, the functions of plotnine are available using p9.. For the
exercise, we will use the surveys.csv data set, with the NA values removed

```python
import pandas as pd

surveys_complete = pd.read_csv('data/surveys.csv')
surveys_complete = surveys_complete.dropna()
```

::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

If learners have trouble generating the output, or anything happens with that, the folder
[sample_output](https://github.com/datacarpentry/python-ecology-lesson/tree/main/sample_output)
in this repository contains the file surveys_complete.csv with the data they should generate.

## Plotting with plotnine

The plotnine package (cfr. other packages conform The Grammar of Graphics) supports the creation of complex plots from data in a
dataframe. It uses default settings, which help creating publication quality
plots with a minimal amount of settings and tweaking.

plotnine graphics are built step by step by adding new elements adding
different elements on top of each other using the + operator. Putting the
individual steps together in brackets () provides Python-compatible syntax.

To build a plotnine graphic we need to:

- Bind the plot to a specific data frame using the data argument:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete))
```

::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Note plotnine contains a *lot* of deprecation warnings in some versions of python/matplotlib, 
warnings may need to be suppressed with

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(action='once')
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As we have not defined anything else, just an empty figure is available and
presented.

- Define aesthetics (aes), by **selecting variables** used in the plot and
  mapping them to a presentation such as plotting size, shape, color, etc. You
  can interpret this as: **which** of the variables will influence the plotted
  objects/geometries:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight', y='hindfoot_length')))
```

The most important aes mappings are: x, y, alpha, color, colour,
fill, linetype, shape, size and stroke.

- Still no specific data is plotted, as we have to define what kind of geometry
  will be used for the plot. The most straightforward is probably using points.
  Points is one of the geoms options, the graphical representation of the data
  in the plot. Others are lines, bars,... To add a geom to the plot use +
  operator:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight', y='hindfoot_length'))
    + p9.geom_point()
)
```

The + in the plotnine package is particularly useful because it allows you
to modify existing plotnine objects. This means you can easily set up plot
*templates* and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above
plot can also be generated with code like this:

```python
# Create
surveys_plot = p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
                         mapping=p9.aes(x='weight', y='hindfoot_length'))

# Draw the plot
surveys_plot + p9.geom_point()
```

## Challenge - bar chart

Working on the surveys_complete data set, use the plot-id column to
create a bar-plot that counts the number of records for each plot. (Check
the documentation of the bar geometry to handle the counts)

## Answers

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='plot_id'))
    + p9.geom_bar()
)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Notes:

- Anything you put in the ggplot() function can be seen by any geom layers
  that you add (i.e., these are universal plot settings). This includes the x
  and y axis you set up in aes().
- You can also specify aesthetics for a given geom independently of the
  aesthetics defined globally in the ggplot() function.

## Building your plots iteratively

Building plots with plotnine is typically an iterative process. We start by
defining the dataset we'll use, lay the axes, and choose a geom. Hence, the
data, aes and geom-* are the elementary elements of any graph:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight', y='hindfoot_length'))
    + p9.geom_point()
)
```

Then, we start modifying this plot to extract more information from it. For
instance, we can add transparency (alpha) to avoid overplotting:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight', y='hindfoot_length'))
    + p9.geom_point(alpha=0.1)
)
```

![](fig/06_alpha_plot.png){alt='scatter plot of hindfoot-length vs weight of rodents,  showing a curve increasing to a plateau'}

We can also add colors for all the points

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight', y='hindfoot_length'))
    + p9.geom_point(alpha=0.1, color='blue')
)
```

![](fig/06_blue_plot.png){alt='scatter plot of hindfoot-length vs weight  of rodents, demonstrating overplotting'}

Or to color each species in the plot differently, map the species_id column
to the color aesthetic:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight',
                          y='hindfoot_length',
                          color='species_id'))
    + p9.geom_point(alpha=0.1)
)
```

![](fig/06_color_plot.png){alt='scatter plot of Hindfoot length vs weight with colors coordinating to specific species, showing abundance in the mid to lower left side of the plot'}

Apart from the adaptations of the arguments and settings of the data, aes
and geom-* elements, additional elements can be added as well, using the +
operator:

- Changing the labels:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight', y='hindfoot_length', color='species_id'))
    + p9.geom_point(alpha=0.1)
    + p9.xlab("Weight (g)")
)
```

![](fig/06_color_label_plot.png){alt='scatter plot of Hindfoot length vs weight (g) with colors coordinating to specific species, showing abundance in the mid to lower left side of the plot'}

- Defining scale for colors, axes,... For example, a log-version of the x-axis
  could support the interpretation of the lower numbers:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight', y='hindfoot_length', color='species_id'))
    + p9.geom_point(alpha=0.1)
    + p9.xlab("Weight (g)")
    + p9.scale_x_log10()
)
```

![](fig/06_log_plot.png){alt='Scatterplot of hindfoot length versus weight where logarithmic x-axis is used to distribute lower numbers'}

- Changing the theme (theme_*) or some specific theming (theme) elements.
  Usually plots with white background look more readable when printed.  We can
  set the background to white using the function theme_bw().

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight', y='hindfoot_length', color='species_id'))
    + p9.geom_point(alpha=0.1)
    + p9.xlab("Weight (g)")
    + p9.scale_x_log10()
    + p9.theme_bw()
    + p9.theme(text=p9.element_text(size=16))
)
```

## Challenge - Bar plot adaptations

Adapt the bar plot of the previous exercise by mapping the sex variable to
the color fill of the bar chart. Change the scale of the color fill by
providing the colors blue and orange manually
(see [API reference](https://plotnine.org/reference/) to find the appropriate function).

    + p9.geom_bar()

## Plotting distributions

Visualizing distributions is a common task during data exploration and
analysis. To visualize the distribution of weight within each species_id
group, a boxplot can be used:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='species_id',
                          y='weight'))
    + p9.geom_boxplot()
)
```

![](fig/06_boxplot.png){alt='boxplot showing distribution of rodent weight for each species group'}

By adding points of the individual observations to the boxplot, we can have a
better idea of the number of measurements and of their distribution:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='species_id',
                          y='weight'))
    + p9.geom_jitter(alpha=0.2)
    + p9.geom_boxplot(alpha=0.)
)
```

![](fig/06_point_boxplot.png){alt='Boxplot of weight by species overlaying observation points to visualize the distribution'}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge - distributions

Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the *shape* of the distribution.
For example, if there is a bimodal distribution, this would not be observed
with a boxplot. An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot (sometimes
known as a beanplot), where the shape (of the density of points) is drawn.

In many types of data, it is important to consider the *scale* of the
observations.  For example, it may be worth changing the scale of the axis
to better distribute the observations in the space of the plot.

- Replace the box plot with a violin plot, see geom_violin()
- Represent weight on the log10 scale, see scale_y_log10()
- Add color to the datapoints on your boxplot according to the plot from which
  the sample was taken (plot_id)

Hint: Check the class for plot_id. By using factor() within the aes
mapping of a variable, plotnine will handle the values as category values.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Plotting time series data

Let's calculate the number of counts per year for each species. To do that we need
to group data first and count the species (species_id) within each group.

```python
yearly_counts = surveys_complete.groupby(['year', 'species_id'])['species_id'].count()
yearly_counts
```

When checking the result of the previous calculation, we actually have both the
year and the species_id as a row index. We can reset this index to use both
as column variable:

```python
yearly_counts = yearly_counts.reset_index(name='counts')
yearly_counts
```

Timelapse data can be visualised as a line plot (geom_line) with years on x
axis and counts on the y axis.

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=yearly_counts,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='year',
                          y='counts'))
    + p9.geom_line()
)
```

Unfortunately this does not work, because we plot data for all the species
together. We need to tell plotnine to draw a line for each species by
modifying the aesthetic function and map the species\_id to the color:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=yearly_counts,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='year',
                          y='counts',
                          color='species_id'))
    + p9.geom_line()
)
```

![](fig/06_time_plot.png){alt='Line graph of count per year where data for each species is indicated by a different color'}

## Faceting

As any other library supporting the Grammar of Graphics, plotnine has a
special technique called *faceting* that allows to split one plot into multiple
plots based on a factor variable included in the dataset.

Consider our scatter plot of the weight versus the hindfoot_length from the
previous sections:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight',
                          y='hindfoot_length',
                          color='species_id'))
    + p9.geom_point(alpha=0.1)
)
```

We can now keep the same code and at the facet_wrap on a chosen variable to
split out the graph and make a separate graph for each of the groups in that
variable. As an example, use sex:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight',
                          y='hindfoot_length',
                          color='species_id'))
    + p9.geom_point(alpha=0.1)
    + p9.facet_wrap("sex")
)
```

![](fig/06_facet_plot.png){alt='2 scatter plots, one for males and the other for females, of hindfoot length vs weight with colored dots denoting specific species, showing the trend is the same between both male and females of multiple species'}

We can apply the same concept on any of the available categorical variables:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight',
                          y='hindfoot_length',
                          color='species_id'))
    + p9.geom_point(alpha=0.1)
    + p9.facet_wrap("plot_id")
)
```

![](fig/06_facet_all_plot.png){alt='24 individual scatter plots of Hindfoot length vs weight of species with colors denoting species and numbers above plot representing 1 of the 24 plots, showing trends for each unique plot id studied'}

The facet_wrap geometry extracts plots into an arbitrary number of dimensions
to allow them to cleanly fit on one page. On the other hand, the facet_grid
geometry allows you to explicitly specify how you want your plots to be
arranged via formula notation (rows ~ columns; a . can be used as a
placeholder that indicates only one row or column).

```python
# only select the years of interest
survey_2000 = surveys_complete[surveys_complete["year"].isin([2000, 2001])]

(p9.ggplot(data=survey_2000,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight',
                          y='hindfoot_length',
                          color='species_id'))
    + p9.geom_point(alpha=0.1)
    + p9.facet_grid("year ~ sex")
)
```

## Further customization

As the syntax of plotnine follows the original R package ggplot2, the
documentation of ggplot2 can provide information and inspiration to customize
graphs. Take a look at the ggplot2 [cheat sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html), and think of ways to
improve the plot. You can write down some of your ideas as comments in the Etherpad.

The theming options provide a rich set of visual adaptations. Consider the
following example of a bar plot with the counts per year.

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='factor(year)'))
    + p9.geom_bar()
)
```

![](fig/06_overlap_bars.png){alt='Bar graph of count per year showing overlapping x-axis labels'}

Notice that we use the year here as a categorical variable by using the
factor functionality. However, by doing so, we have the individual year
labels overlapping with each other. The theme functionality provides a way to
rotate the text of the x-axis labels:

```python
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='factor(year)'))
    + p9.geom_bar()
    + p9.theme_bw()
    + p9.theme(axis_text_x = p9.element_text(angle=90))
)
```

![](fig/06_good_bars.png){alt='Bar graph of count per year demonstrating how the theme function rotates the x-axis labels'}

When you like a specific set of theme-customizations you created, you can save
them as an object to easily apply them to other plots you may create:

```python
my_custom_theme = p9.theme(axis_text_x = p9.element_text(color="grey", size=10,
                                                         angle=90, hjust=.5),
                           axis_text_y = p9.element_text(color="grey", size=10))
(p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='factor(year)'))
    + p9.geom_bar()
    + my_custom_theme
)
```

![](fig/06_theme_plot.png){alt='Bar graph of count per year demonstrating the use of a customized theme'}

## Challenge - customization

Please take another five minutes to either improve one of the plots
generated in this exercise or create a beautiful graph of your own.

Here are some ideas:

- See if you can change thickness of lines for the line plot .
- Can you find a way to change the name of the legend? What about its labels?
- Use a different color palette (see [http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors\_(ggplot2)](https://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_\(ggplot2\)))
  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

After creating your plot, you can save it to a file in your favourite format.
You can easily change the dimension (and its resolution) of your plot by
adjusting the appropriate arguments (width, height and dpi):

```python
my_plot = (p9.ggplot(data=surveys_complete,
           mapping=p9.aes(x='weight', y='hindfoot_length'))
    + p9.geom_point()
)
my_plot.save("scatterplot.png", width=10, height=10, dpi=300)
```
